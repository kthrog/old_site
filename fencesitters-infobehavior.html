	<b>KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS STUDY</b>
	<p>
	<p>This study is researching the information behavior — the process of seeking, gathering, and using information — of those unsure of    whether or not they want to have children (called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/" target="blank">“fencesitters” on this subreddit</a>), with the intent of developing a new model of information behavior in the field of library and information science (LIS), ideally one that is less linear than current models, and more aligned with the complexity of information-seeking behavior online, especially in internet forums.

	<b>WHY YOU MIGHT WISH TO PARTICIPATE</b>

	<p> 
	<p> Subjects may wish to join this study to learn more about how people choose whether or not to have a child — to better understand the process for themselves, and for others. Subjects may also wish to join this study to further research and resources in this area.

	<b>WHY YOU MIGHT NOT WISH TO PARTICIPATE</b>
	<p>
