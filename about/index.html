		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Currently, Kaitlin Throgmorton works as an associate bioinformatics analyst and data curator at Sage Bionetworks, where she's part of the computational oncology team. Most of her work centers on data curation to promote open science in the areas of neurofibromatosis and immunotherapy. 
		<p>After a decade of managing projects for state government, nonprofits, and freelance clients, Kaitlin decided to go back to school to learn more about libraries, information, and data. In 2018, she began her graduate studies in library and information science at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, where she focused on  open data, data curation, information literacy, and digital equity -- and in 2020, she graduated with her master's (MLIS). While at UW, she worked as a research assistant for the Open Data Literacy (ODL) project, and she spent a summer interning for the City of Seattle's Open Data (data.seattle.gov) team. Her final capstone project, <a href="https://opendatawagon.github.io/">Open Data Wagon</a>, focused on publishing open bookmobile data.</p>
		<p>Before grad school, she worked in communications, public relations, journalism, and editing. She holds bachelor's degrees in English and Spanish from Covenant College.
