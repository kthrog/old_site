	<h2>Hi, I'm Kaitlin Throgmorton.</h2>
	<p>I'm a library and information science graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle, graduating with my MLIS in June 2020, and I'm <b>passionate about making information open, equitable, and accessible for everyone.</b> 
	<p>I'm especially excited by open data, open records, and open educational resources, and many of my recent projects center on open data in public libraries, data curation, digital literacy, and new, internet-influenced information behavior models.
