	<h1>Hi, I'm Kaitlin Throgmorton.</h1>
	<p>I'm a library and information science graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I'm passionate about making information as open and accessible as possible. While at the iSchool, I'm focused on open data, data curation, and digital equity. I currently work as a research assistant for the <a href="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu">Open Data Literacy project</a>, and before grad school, I worked in communications, writing, and editing, mostly for state government and nonprofits.
